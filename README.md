# Arilou
The best programming language ever

Language specification:

A Compiled language that runs in Interpreted mode.

The language is designed to follow natural grammar. German grammar was selected as the most accurate.

The compiler will make sure the following important guidelines are strictly obeyed:

All variables must start with var_ . 

Strict Hungarian notation.

Variables and Classes must use both underscore and camelCase.

Classes and code constructs must both be indented and surrounded by curly braces.

Curly braces must stick to the original GNU style, unless the GeoIP detected an Egyptian user, in which case Egyptian style must be used.

All objects are first class variable types, except for second class objects.

Classes support inheritance, albeit with an inheritance tax.

In order to reduce valuable resources, a nop penalty is applied between code lines.

In order to reduce line length, a nop penalty is applied every 30 characters.

All lines must end with a semi colon.

Subsequent, concatenated methods take German style annotation str.StripConcatSchlaffenGehen.

All variable are global, unless declared a the top.

Variables must be declared by the PleaseLét keyword.

All functions must be Lambda functions.

The notation for assignment must end with a ! and begin with a ¡ .

The notation for conditionals must end with a ? and begin with a ¿ .

The official IDE is the best one available (Eclipse).

The language does not support pointers, but allows the use of pointels, which are similar but annotated with a # .

Preliminary release starts at version 3.0 and goes down to 2.7 .

Arrays are zero based.

1D vectors are one based.

While the code requires Unicode, input and output are ASCII only (for simplicity).

All output is automatically logged. To /dev/null .

For speed and optimization, all output is performed using ultra fast poke operations.

Unit tests are run at a slower rate, as it is usually required to pass in production systems.

All variables must be exactly 8 characters long and contain both alphanumerical and hexadecimal numbers.

For security, all variable names must be changed every 30 days, pending a captcha test.

The language will have built-in whiteboard test infrastructure. Fizz_Buzz, DFS, BFS and Reverse_Linked_List are all language primitives.

Else If will be annotated as Else_Oops_Just_thought_Of_Another_Condition_If

For elegance, the grpahical pallete will be limited to the Snow White design language.

Casting operations are allowed and encouraged. To reduce the amount of duplicate cast operations, each cast is sticky and permanent until cast again to another type.

The underlying technology under the hood will be Lisp.

Unlike Matlab anc C that store 2D arrays in memory column based or row based, Arielou uses diagonal based memory management which is fantastic when using the identity matrix.
